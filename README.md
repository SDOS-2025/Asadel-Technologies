## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing
- **React Bootstrap**: UI component library
- **React Icons**: For iconography

### Backend
- **Flask**: Python web framework for the API
- **MySQL Connector**: For database interactions
- **JWT**: For secure authentication

### Database
- **MySQL**: For storing user data, camera configurations, regions, and system settings

### AI/ML
- **Custom pretrained models**: For fire and smoke detection

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Module**: React-based dashboard for user interaction
2. **Backend Module**: Flask API with Blueprint-based organization
3. **Detection Module**: Handles integration with AI models
4. **Database Module**: Manages data storage and retrieval
5. **Authentication Module**: Handles user authentication and authorization

This modular approach allows for:
- Independent development and testing of components
- Easy replacement or upgrade of individual modules
- Scalability to handle additional detection tasks or features

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- MySQL (v8.0 or higher)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/fire-smoke-detection.git
cd fire-smoke-detection
```

2. Set up Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
# Edit backend/.env file with your database credentials
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_username
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=asadel_db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
python backend/init_db.py
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
python backend/app.py
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
