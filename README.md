## üîç Overview

This project is a comprehensive frontend solution for a fire/smoke detection system that integrates with pretrained AI models to provide real-time detection alerts. The system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension to other detection tasks in the future.

The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring multiple camera feeds, configuring detection parameters, and viewing detection logs and analytics.

## ‚ú® Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard
- Real-time monitoring of multiple camera feeds
- Intuitive navigation between different system modules
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

### üìπ Camera Management
- Add, edit, and delete camera configurations
- Configure RTSP URLs for video streams
- Organize cameras by regions and sub-regions

### üö® Detection Alerts
- Real-time fire and smoke detection alerts
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Visual and optional audio notifications

### üìä Analytics & Reporting
- Historical detection data visualization
- Exportable reports in multiple formats
- Customizable date range filtering

### üë• User Management
- Role-based access control
- User activity logging
- Secure authentication system

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration
- Adjustable detection sensitivity

- System performance settings

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing
- **React Bootstrap**: UI component library
- **React Icons**: For iconography


### Backend
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **Express**: Web framework
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication

### Database
- **MySQL**: For storing detection logs, user data, and system configuration

### AI/ML
- **TensorFlow.js**: For client-side model inference
- **Custom pretrained models**: For fire and smoke detection


## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Module**: React-based dashboard for user interaction
2. **Detection Module**: Handles integration with AI models
3. **Database Module**: Manages data storage and retrieval
4. **API Module**: Facilitates communication between frontend and backend

This modular approach allows for:
- Independent development and testing of components
- Easy replacement or upgrade of individual modules
- Scalability to handle additional detection tasks

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- MySQL (v8.0 or higher)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/fire-smoke-detection.git
cd fire-smoke-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
